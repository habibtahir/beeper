# DigiSkills Video Reminder

**DigiSkills Video Reminder**

A simple JavaScript sound beeper, used as a reminder

A simple beeper, to remind my daughter that it's time to start the next video lecture at <a href="https://digiskills.pk" target="_blank">DigiSkills</a>. When she didn't have time to watch the full length video lectures and that was the last day of the course. If the video is watched for 40 to 50 seconds, the status becomes seen and green. This script beeps every 50 seconds and then she instantly clicks on the next video.

Developed, when I've bored doing office work since 23 Hrs.
